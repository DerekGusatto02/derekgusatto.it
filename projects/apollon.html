            <p>The project consist of the design of a Database (Requirements Analysis, Conceptual Design, Logical Design, Relational Schema) and the study of some queries and indexes. The Database was designed in PostgreSQL and the queries are executed from a command-line C++ project. </p>

            <h3>Project requirements</h3>
            <p> 
                To be acceptable, a project must have the following minimum requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li>The project’s E-R diagram must contain an adequate number of entities (≥ 5) excluding those involved in a hierarchy (only the parent entity counts);</li>
                    <li>At least one significant hierarchy;</li>
                    <li>An example of a relationship for each type of cardinality (1:N, 1:1, N:M).</li>
                </ul>
                The Project must also include:
                <ul>
                    <li>5 to 10 significant queries that cover (as a whole) the entire database and answer interesting questions about the database;</li>
                    <li>3 of the above queries must use the “group by” and/or aggregate operators;</li>
                    <li>at least 1 query of the above queries must use the “group by” and “having”;</li>
                    <li>introduce at least one significant secondary index: assume a large-scale use case and justify the choice of the index(es).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
